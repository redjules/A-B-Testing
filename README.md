# A/B Testing Approach for Comparing Performance of ML Models

# Project Description

# Business Overview

It is essential to test a machine learning model before replacing an existing one in production. The new model may have a different performance than the existing model. Testing the new model helps evaluate its performance on a test dataset and ensures it meets the required accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. Testing the model can help identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting the data. If the model is overfitting, it is too complex and has learned the noise in the training data, which can lead to poor generalization of new data. If the model is underfitting, it is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the data. Testing the model on different datasets can help ensure that the model is robust and can generalize well to new data. Testing the model can help identify the types of errors the model is making and help improve the model's performance by addressing these errors. Replacing a model can have an impact on the user experience. Testing the new model can help ensure that the change does not adversely affect the user experience. Testing a machine learning model before replacing an existing one in production is crucial to ensure that the new model performs well, is robust, and does not adversely affect the user experience.

A/B testing, also known as split testing or bucket testing, compares two versions of a product or service to determine which one performs better. In machine learning, A/B testing is used to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models or algorithms. A/B testing involves randomly assigning users or data points to two groups: a control group and a treatment group. The control group is presented with the existing model or algorithm, while the treatment group is presented with the new model or algorithm. The performance of both models is then compared based on the same set of evaluation metrics, such as accuracy or precision.

A/B testing in machine learning determines if the new model or algorithm performs better than the existing one. This is important in applications where the model's performance is critical, such as fraud detection or autonomous driving. AB testing helps to ensure that the new model is not only better than the existing one but also statistically significant. To conduct AB testing in machine learning, it is essential to have a large and diverse dataset and a clear definition of the evaluation metrics. The results of AB testing can be used to improve the performance of the model or algorithm and ultimately improve the overall user experience.

In this project, we will create a Question and Answer system using the BERT and DistilBERT models. BERT is a transformer-based model that uses a bidirectional approach to language modeling. DistilBERT is based on the same transformer architecture as BERT but has fewer layers and parameters, making it smaller and faster to train and use. We will apply A/B testing to determine which model out of BERT and DistilBERT models performs better.

 

# Tech Stack

- Language: Python

- Models: BERT, DistilBERT

# BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained neural network architecture for natural language processing (NLP) developed by Google. It uses a technique called "Transformer" to process input text and create contextualized word embeddings, which can be used for a variety of NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and question answering.
BERT has been widely used in industry and research for a variety of NLP tasks, and its pre-trained models have been made publicly available for use by developers and researchers. Other variations of the BERT model have also been developed, such as RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, which have achieved even higher performance on various benchmarks.

# DistilBERT

DistilBERT is a smaller and faster version of the BERT model that was introduced by researchers at Hugging Face in 2019. It is designed to be more memory-efficient and faster to train than the original BERT model, while still maintaining a high level of performance on various NLP tasks. The main innovation of DistilBERT is a technique called "distillation", which involves training a smaller model to mimic the behavior of a larger, more complex model. In the case of DistilBERT, the model is trained to predict the same masked words as the original BERT model, but with a smaller number of Transformer layers and fewer attention heads. 
DistilBERT has become a popular choice for many NLP applications, and has been used in various research and industry applications. The model is available for download and use through Hugging Face's transformers library, which provides a wide range of pre-trained NLP models for developers and researchers.
